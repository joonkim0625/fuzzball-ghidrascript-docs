Welcome!

This project, conducted under the supervision of Professor McCamant at the
University of Minnesota, is on a mission to elevate the accessibility of
FuzzBALL, a powerful symbolic execution tool for binary code available on GitHub
at [https://github.com/bitblaze-fuzzball/fuzzball](https://github.com/bitblaze-fuzzball/fuzzball). In focusing on two pivotal aspects, we aim to make FuzzBALL
more user-friendly and relevant to a broader audience.

**Linux Compatibility**: The project's primary goal is to ensure the seamless
integration of FuzzBALL with modern Linux-based operating systems, including the
widely used Ubuntu. By enhancing compatibility, we're making FuzzBALL more
user-friendly and extending its relevance to a broader audience. For now, the
project aims to be compatible with Ubuntu 20.04. 

**Integration with Ghidra**: I am excited to share the progress made in developing
a Ghidra script that facilitates the integration of FuzzBALL with
Ghidra, a leading reverse engineering tool. This integration empowers users to
harness FuzzBALL's capabilities directly within the Ghidra environment,
enhancing binary analysis and streamlining workflows.

Why does it matter?

The main objective of this project is to invite the Capture the Flag (CTF)
community into the world of FuzzBALL. I am confident that FuzzBALL can serve as
an invaluable tool for conquering CTF challenges. Through this initiative, our
goal is not only to expand the FuzzBALL user base but also to establish a
valuable resource for those passionate about binary analysis and security. Join
us on this exciting journey as we make FuzzBALL more accessible, user-friendly,
and indispensable for the CTF community. Let's unlock the full potential of
FuzzBALL together!
